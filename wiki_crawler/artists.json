In Munich, Kubin discovered the works of Odilon Redon, Edvard Munch, James Ensor, Henry de Groux, and F\u00e9licien Rops.

Before putting the engravings away I swore that I would dedicate my life to the creation of similar works\".[2] The aquatint technique used by Klinger and Goya influenced the style of his works of this period, which are mainly ink and wash drawings of fantastical, often macabre subjects.[1] Kubin produced a small number of oil paintings in the years between 1902 and 1910, but thereafter his output consisted of pen and ink drawings, watercolors, and lithographs. In 1911, he became associated with the Blaue Reiter group, and exhibited with them in the Galerie Der Sturm in Berlin in 1913.[2] After that time, he lost contact with the artistic avant-garde.", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alfred_kubin"}, {"name": "vincent van gogh", "born": "Vincent Willem van Gogh30 March 1853Zundert, Netherlands", "died": "29 July 1890(1890-07-29) (aged\u00a037)Auvers-sur-Oise, France", "nationality": "Dutch", "pic_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vincent_van_gogh#/media/File:Vincent_van_Gogh_-_Self-Portrait_-_Google_Art_Project_(454045).jpg", "desc": "Vincent Willem van Gogh (Dutch:\u00a0[\u02c8v\u026ans\u025bnt \u02c8\u028b\u026al\u0259m v\u0251\u014b \u02c8\u0263\u0254x] (listen);[note 1] 30 March 1853\u00a0\u2013 29 July 1890) was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art.

Letters from John Singleton, Mrs. Copley's father, are in the Copley-Pelham collection.

It is certain that the widow Copley was married to Peter Pelham on May 22, 1748, and that at about that time she transferred her tobacco business to his house in Lindall Street (a quieter, more respectable part of town), at which the evening school also continued its sessions. In such a household young Copley may have learned to use the paintbrush and the engraver's tools. Whitmore says plausibly: \"Copley at the age of fifteen was able to engrave in mezzotint; his stepfather Pelham, with whom he lived three years, was an excellent engraver and skillful also with the brush.\"[8] The family lived next to the house occupied by japanner Thomas Johnston and his family, and Copley became friends with Thomas's son William, later to become a painter himself.[9]", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Singleton_Copley"}, {"name": "thomas jefferson", "born": "", "died": "July 4, 1826(1826-07-04) (aged\u00a083)Charlottesville, Virginia, U.S.", "nationality": null, "pic_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thomas_jefferson#/media/File:Official_Presidential_portrait_of_Thomas_Jefferson_(by_Rembrandt_Peale,_1800)(cropped).jpg", "desc": "Thomas Jefferson (April 13, 1743[a] \u2013 July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, diplomat, lawyer, architect, philosopher, and Founding Father who served as the third president of the United States from 1801 to 1809.

By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds, and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\".
